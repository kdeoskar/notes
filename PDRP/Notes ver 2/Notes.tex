These are some notes from the Phyiscs Directed Reading Program (PDRP) group headed by graduate student Vi Hong. Our group was interested in learning about topology and geometry with applications (primarily) to condensed matter physics.

    Note: These notes are very terse and not recommended as a primary source for learning.
