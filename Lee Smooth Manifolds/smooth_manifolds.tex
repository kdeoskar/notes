\title{Introduction to Smooth Manifolds - Some solutions}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This is a collection of my personal solutions to some exercises from the book 'Introduction to Smooth Manifolds' (2nd edition) by John M. Lee.

These solutions are being written up and I work through the book, however I do not write up every exercise/problem and leave many to be updated later.

This has been written solely to deepen my own understanding of the material, but please feel free to contact me with corrections, concerns, or comments at kdeoskar@berkeley.edu.

\textbf{Exercise 1.6:} Show that $\mathbb{RP}^n$ is Hausdorff and second-countable, and is therefore a topological $n$-manifold. 

\vskip 0.5cm
\textbf{Proof:}

\vskip 0.5cm
To show Hausdorffness, consider two distinct points $x, y \in \mathbb{RP}^n, x \neq y$. Then, 

\vskip 0.5cm
To show second-countability, we use the following lemma:
\begin{dottedbox}
    For a topological space $X$ with countable basis $\mathcal{B}$
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Any of its subsets $Y \subseteq X$ has a countable basis as well ($\mathcal{B}_Y = \{U : U = B \cap Y, B \in \mathcal{B}\}$)
    \item If $Z = \bigslant{X}{\sim}$ is a quotient space of $X$ by an equivalence relation $\sim$, then 
    \[ \{ [x]_{\sim} : x \in B \in \mathcal{B} \} \]
    will be a countable base for the topology induced on $Z$ 
\end{enumerate}
\vskip 0.5cm

\underline{\textbf{Proof of Lemma:}} Do later.
\end{dottedbox}

\vskip 0.5cm
Applying $(a)$ tells us that $\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \setminus \{0\}$ as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ has a countable basis. Then, applying $(b)$ with $Z = \mathbb{RP}^n = \bigslant{\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \setminus \{0\}}{\sim}$ where $x \sim y$ if and only if $x = \lambda y$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, tells us that $\mathbb{RP}^n$ too has a countable basis.

\textbf{Exercise 4.9:} Show that the conclusions of Proposition 4.8 still hold if $N$ is a manifold with boundary but not if $M$ is.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vskip 0.5cm

\textbf{Proof (Sketch):}

\begin{itemize}
  \item  It follows from the result of Problem 4-2 that if $p \in M$ such that $dF_p$ is non-singular, then $F(p) \in \mathrm{Int}(N)$, which is an manifold without boundary, so naturally the results still apply. 
  
  \item If, however, $M$ has non-empty boundary, then the Inverse Function Theorem for manifolds breaks down (See result of Problem 4-1).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Exercise 4.10:} Suppose $M, N, P$ are manifolds with or without boundary and $F : M \rightarrow N$ is a local diffeomorphism. Prove the following:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item If $G : P \rightarrow M$ is countinuous, $G$ is smooth iff $F \circ G$ is smooth.
  \item If $F$ is surjective and $G : N \rightarrow P$ is any map, then $G$ is smooth iff $G \circ F$ is smooth.
\end{enumerate} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vskip 0.5cm

\textbf{Proof:}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Suppose $G$ is smooth, then at each point $p \in M$, $F \circ G$ is the composition of a two smooth maps (local diffeomorphisms restrict to smooth maps around each point). Conversely if $F \circ G$ is smooth, let $p \in P$ and let $U \subseteq M$ be an open set containing $G(p)$ such that $\restr{F}{U} : U \rightarrow V \subseteq N$ is a local diffeomorphsm. Since $G$ is continuous, $G^{-1}(U) \subseteq P$ is open. So, of course, $\restr{F \circ G}{G^{-1}(U)}$ restricts to a smooth map on $G^{-1}(U)$. Then, $\restr{G}{G^{-1}(U)} : G^{-1}(U) \rightarrow U$ can be written as 
  \[ \restr{G}{G^{-1}(U)} = \restr{\left(F \circ G\right)}{G^{-1}(U)} \circ \restr{F^{-1}}{F(U)} \]
  so $\restr{G}{G^{-1}(U)}$ is a composition of smooth maps, and is thus smooth itself. We have smooth restrictions for each point $p \in P$ which we can glue together using the Gluing Lemma for smooth functions, to find that $G$ is continuous.

  \vskip 0.5cm
  \item Suppose $G$ smooth, then $G \circ F$ is the composition of smooth maps and is thus smooth. Conversely, suppose $G \circ F$ is smooth. $F$ is a surjective local diffeomorphism, so for any point $n \in N$ we can write 
  \[ G = \left( G \circ F \right) \circ F^{-1}   \]
  So, $G$ is the composition of two smooth maps and is itself a smooth map.

\subsection{Embeddings}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{Exercise 4.16:} Show that every composition of smooth embeddings is a smooth embedding. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vskip 0.5cm

\textbf{Proof:}


Consider manifolds without boundaries $M, N, P$ and smooth embeddings $F : M \rightarrow N, G : N \rightarrow P$. Then, $F$ and $G$ are individually homeomorphisms onto their images, thus their composition $G \circ F$ is as well. 

\vskip 0.25cm
Also, since both $F, G$ are smooth immersions, they are both smooth maps whose differentials are injective. So, their composition $G \circ F$ is smooth too, and its differential (given by the chain rule as) at a point $p \in M$
\[ d\left(G \circ F\right)_{p} = dG_{F(p)} \circ dF_{p} \]
is the composition of two injective linear maps, thus it is also injective.
