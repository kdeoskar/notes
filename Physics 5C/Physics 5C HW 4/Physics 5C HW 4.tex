\section*{Attosecond Physics : A Glimpse into the life of electrons}

On October 3, 2023 the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz, and Anne Lâ€™Huillier for their contributions to experimental methods of generating \emph{attosecond pulses of light}.
But why was this such a big deal? And what novel frontiers of research does \emph{attosecond physics} open up to us?

\subsection*{How Attosecond Pulses are Generated:}
\begin{itemize}
   \item The breakthrough method which was the cause for this Nobel Prize to be awarded is \emph{High-Harmonic Generation}.

   \item This method makes use of a non-linear interaction between gaseous molecules and a laser light to generate extremely sharp burst of radiation -- on the attosecond scale.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Why is this particular time-scale important?}
\begin{itemize}
   \item In previous years, experimental methods of producing radiation on time-scales all the way down to Femto-seconds ($10^{-15}s$) were pioneered. These are \emph{incredibly} fast pulses of light.
   \item However, when it comes to studying \textbf{electrons} -- particles whose behavior essentally dictate all of chemsitry and much of physics -- that's simply not fast enough.
   \item Electrons travel on the time-scale of Attoseconds i.e. $10^{-18}s$. So, being able to produce light pulses on this time-scale means we can 
   \emph{directly study the motion and interactions of electrons!}
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{So, what can it be used for?}
\begin{itemize}
   \item As mentioned earlier, attosecond physics allows us to study the real-time motion of electrons.
   \item Studying the motion of electrons withnin a molecule can tell us about its \emph{shape} and various other properties. This could aide in a variety of fields such as Biology and Medicine (eg. studying the shapes of enzymes/proteins etc. that could propel Medicine synthesis), Materal Science, and many other fields.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{But what about its applcations \emph{in Physics}?}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Within physics, too, this breakthrough opens up new frontiers. 
   \item Some interesting applications include 
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item Watching Quantum Interference build up over time
      \item Directly Observing the Oscillations of the Electric Field.
   \end{enumerate}
   Developments like the one regarding osciallations of the electric field not only further physics, but also give us more to work with when thinking about the \emph{philosophy} of physics.

   In conclusion, Attosecond physics allows us to peer deeper than ever before and gves us a multitude of options to explore for future research.
