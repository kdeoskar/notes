\textbf{Q4-5.} Let $\mathbb{CP}^n$ denote the $n-$dimensional complex projective space. 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Show that the quotient map $\pi : \C^{n+1} \setminus \{0\} \rightarrow \mathbb{CP}^n$ is a surjective smooth submersion.
  \item Show that $\mathbb{CP}^n$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^n$.

\textbf{Q5-6.} Suppose $M \subseteq \R^n$ is an embedded $m-$dimensional submanifold, and let $UM \subseteq T \R^n$ be the set of all \emph{unit} tangent vectors to $M$:
\[ UM = \{ (x, v) \in T \R^n \; : \; x\in M, v \in T_{x} M, \; \left| v \right| = 1 \} \]

This is called the \emph{\textbf{Unit Tangent Bundle of $M$.}} Prove that $UM$ is an embedded  $(2n-1)-$dimensional submanifold of $T \R^n \approx \R^n \times \R^{n}$.
