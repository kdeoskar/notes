\textbf{Q7-2.} Let $G$ be a Lie Group.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Let $m : G \times G \rightarrow G$ denote the multiplication map. Using proposition 3.14 to identify $T_{(e,e)} \left(G \times G\right)$ with $T_{e}G \oplus T_e G$, show that the differential $dM_{(e,e)} : T_e G \oplus T_e G \rightarrow T_e G$ is given by 
  \[ dm_{(e,e)}\left(X, Y\right) = X + Y \]

  \item Let $i : G \rightarrow G$ denote the invversion map. Show that $di_e : T_e G \rightarrow T_e G$ is given by $di_e(X) = -X $.

\textbf{Q7-4.} Let $\mathrm{det} : GL(n, \R) \rightarrow \R$ denote the determinant function. Use Corollary 3.25 to compute the differential of det, as follows.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item For any $A \in M(n, \R)$, show that 
  \[ \restr{\frac{d}{dt}}{t = 0} \mathrm{det}(I_n + tA) = \mathrm{tr}A \], where $\mathrm{tr}\left(A^i_j\right) = \sum_{i} A^i_i$ is the trace of $A$.
  
  \item For $X \in GL(n, \R)$ and $B \in T_X GL(n, \R) \cong M(n,\R)$, show that 
  \[ d\left(\mathrm{det}\right)_X (B) = \left( \mathrm{det} X \right) \mathrm{tr} \left(X^{-1} B\right) \].

  \item Show that quaternionic multiplication is associative but not commutative.
  \item Show that $(pq)^* = q^* p^*$ for all $p, \in \mathbb{H}$
  \item Show that $\langle p, q \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\left(p^* q + q^* p\right)$ is an iner product on $\mathbb{H}$, whose associated norm satisfies $|pq| = |p||q|$.
  \item Show that every nonzero quaternion has a two-sided multiplicative inverse given by $p^{-1} = |p|^{-2} p^*$.
